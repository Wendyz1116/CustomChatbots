# Custom AI Chatbot Creator

## Technologies
- **React**
- **Next.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **GraphQL API**
- **Groq API** (formerly OpenAI API)

## Description
Custom AI Chatbot Creator is inspired by Sonny Sangha's AI Help Bot. This project integrates the Groq API due to the discontinuation of free access to the OpenAI API. It also includes updates to PostgreSQL queries and mutations to resolve errors from the original implementation.

## Note
UI design is still being finalized.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
