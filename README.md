## Description

Custom AI Chatbot Creator, inspired by Sonny Sangha's AI Help Bot, allows users to build and customize AI chatbots. The project integrates the Groq API due to the discontinuation of free access to the OpenAI API and includes updates to PostgreSQL queries and mutations to resolve errors from the original implementation.

## New Features and Enhancements
  
- **Advanced Prompt Suggestions**: I designed and coded a new AI feature where I generate tailored prompt suggestions using Groq API based on the chatbot's characteristics.
  
- **Interactive Suggestion Button**: During chats, users can also benefit from the AI prompt suggestion with a suggestion button that provides prompt suggestions, enhancing the flow of the conversations.

- **Refined User Authentication**: Users now have the option to sign in with Email or continue as a guest. The sign-in prompt is strategically placed after users send their message, offering them the chance to explore the chatbot and see what kind of prompt it can answer before having to sign in.
  
- **Enhanced Page Layouts**: I've redesigned the layouts for various pages and reorganized the folder structure to provide a more detailed and user-friendly experience for interacting with chatbots.
